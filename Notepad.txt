Linear Regression:
	AQI=β0+β1x1+β2x2+…+βnxn+ϵ
Explanation:
Data Preparation:

We gather historical data on AQI, PM2.5 concentration (x1), temperature (x2), and possibly other relevant variables (xn).
This data is organized into a dataset where each observation contains values for AQI, PM2.5 concentration, temperature, and other predictors.

Model Training:

We use the historical data to train the linear regression model.
During training, the model learns the coefficients (β's) and the intercept (β0) that minimize the difference between the predicted AQI values and the actual AQI values in the training dataset.
The model learns how changes in PM2.5 concentration (x1), temperature (x2), and other predictors (xn) affect the AQI.

Support Vector Machine:
	AQI=∑i=1n αi⋅K(xi,xnew)+b
Where:

AQI
AQI is the predicted air quality index value.
n is the number of support vectors.
xi represents the i-th support vector.
xnew represents the new observation for which AQI is being predicted.
αi are the Lagrange multipliers (also called dual coefficients) associated with each support vector.
K(xi,xnew) is the kernel function, which measures the similarity between the support vector xi and the new observation xnew.
b is the bias term or intercept.
